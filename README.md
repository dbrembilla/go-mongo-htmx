# go-mongo-htmx

This repository contains a test project where I am studying different new technologies:
- Golang
- htmx
- MongoDB
All of these by using Docker and the ages dataset.

## TODO

- Fix the imports, move them from CSV to JSON and allow for default "undefined" value
- Add another function to the frontend (search?)
- Find a way to automate the import of the dataset
- Add build and develop info to this Readme!
